 CodTech Data Analysis Internship Deliverables

This repository contains the completed tasks for the CodTech Data Analysis Internship.

---

## Task 1: Big Data Analysis (PySpark)

### Goal
To perform analysis on a large dataset (1 Million records) using PySpark to demonstrate scalability and distributed processing capabilities.

### Technologies Used
* PySpark (for distributed processing and transformation)
* Pandas & Matplotlib (for visualization of aggregated results)

### Key Insight
The analysis successfully calculated the total revenue across all 1 million transactions in milliseconds, identifying **[E.g., Electronics] as the highest revenue-generating category. This demonstrates the efficiency of PySpark over traditional tools for large data volumes.

## Task 2: Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning

### Goal
To build a classification model (Logistic Regression) to predict survival outcomes based on the Titanic dataset, demonstrating core steps of the ML workflow.

### Model Used
Logistic Regression (Classification Model)

### Key Insight
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately **81.01%**, demonstrating effective predictive capability. The most influential features for the prediction were **Sex (Male)** and **Passenger Class (Pclass)**, confirming the strong social bias in survival rates.

## Task 3: Interactive Sales Dashboard
Developed an interactive Sales Performance Dashboard using Tableau to visualize and analyze the Superstore dataset.

### Key Insights:
* Regional Performance:Identified the West and East regions as the leading contributors to total sales.
* Category Profitability: Technology and Office Supplies are the most profitable categories, while Furniture shows lower margins.
* Monthly Sales Trend: Observed seasonal peaks in sales, especially during the year-end periods.

### Files Included:
* Tableau Workbook: https://github.com/asna123456/Codetech-Data-Analysis-Internship/blob/87571065cabac501fdcc0f52391faa9e606e7e14/Superstore%20task%203.twbx
* Dashboard PDF: https://github.com/asna123456/Codetech-Data-Analysis-Internship/blob/87571065cabac501fdcc0f52391faa9e606e7e14/Superstore%20task%203.pdf




## Task 4: Sentiment Analysis using NLP

Performed sentiment analysis on textual data to classify text into different categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

### Key Highlights:
* Preprocessing: Cleaned raw text by removing special characters, numbers, and converting to lowercase to improve model performance.
* Feature Extraction: Utilized TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text data into numerical format.
* Model:Implemented the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm.
* Performance: Achieved a high accuracy of 98.60% on the test dataset.

### Deliverables:
* Jupyter Notebook: https://github.com/asna123456/Codetech-Data-Analysis-Internship/blob/3b88ff607dd0247dacc712cddd09a92ba5523c3c/task4.ipynb
